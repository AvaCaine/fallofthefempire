# Illegal Activities
The Fempire has been known to use illegal methods of control, and has actively threatened anyone who spoke out.

  - CNSL & Nim bullied someone, and stole their info, threatening their family, threatening also to leak their home address as well.

CNSL made false accusations that the server "Femboy Fun" was threatening to dox him, when the reality was, it was the other way around.

Of course, these bold statements are not without [evidence](https://avacaine.github.io/fallofthefempire/src/evidence).
